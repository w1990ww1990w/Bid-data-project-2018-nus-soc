It's a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game"">trading card game</a>; and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p> <p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface; <code>ICard</code>; which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p> <p>Now; to make the thing maintainable/moddable; I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card; I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh; without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p> <p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it; etc.</p> <pre><code>ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056(); Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState); </code></pre> <p>The language is C#; but extra bonus if it's possible to write the script in any .NET language.</p>"
330,63,2008-08-02T02:51:36Z,,29,Should I use nested classes in this case?,<p>I am working on a collection of classes used for video playback and recording. I have one main class which acts like the public interface; with methods like <code>play()</code>; <code>stop()</code>; <code>pause()</code>; <code>record()</code> etc... Then I have workhorse classes which do the video decoding and video encoding. </p> <p>I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++; and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are; but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p> <p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine; a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class; so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use; and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

Now; there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch; even do with current complexity of those scripts; i might switch to PowerShell or so later); Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p> <p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data; as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p> <p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes; is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again; Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p> <p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data; the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead; which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p> <p>Now; i hear a lot of great stuff about the <a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm"">Red Gate</a> products; but for hobby projects; the price is a bit steep.</p> <p>So; what are you using to automatically deploy SQL Server Databases from Test to Live?</p>"

The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to <code>HKCU</code> for every user on the computer. They need to be in the <code>HKCU</code> rather than <code>HKLM</code> because they are the default user settings; and they do change per user. My feeling is that</p> <ol> <li>This isn't possible</li> <li>This isn't something the installer should be doing; but something the application should be doing (after all what happens when a user profile is created after the install?).</li> </ol> <p>With that in mind; I still want to change as little as possible in the application; so my question is; <strong>is it possible to add registry entries for every user in a <code>Visual Studio 2003</code> setup project?</strong> </p> <p>And; at the moment the project lists five registry root keys (<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT; HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>; <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code>; <code>HKEY_USERS</code>; and User/Machine Hive). I don't really know anything about the Users root key; and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhaps they could solve my problem above.</p>

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.</p> <p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p> <p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?</p> <hr> <p>We do use LabVIEW and I have checked the <a href=""http://forums.lavag.org/Peak-Detection-t8499.html"">LAVA forums</a> and there are a number of interesting examples.

However; I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So; I tried to have the hours split between (today; up to 5pm) and (tomorrow; from 8am on); such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am; because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>"

I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board.
My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server; skinning it and extending it?<br>,,,,,,
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server; the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors. I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work. I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful; particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>,,,,,,
,,,,,,
<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving). Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers; it doesn't support multiple authors; there is no built in syndication; it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>,,,,,,
,,,,,,
<p>another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case; but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others. ExpressionEngine looks promising; will try it out on my personal box.</p>,,,,,,
